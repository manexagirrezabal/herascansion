# English corpus
We used a corpus of English poetry for training and testing our models, called [For Better For Verse](https://github.com/waynegraham/for_better_for_verse/tree/master/poems). This corpus was developed by Herbert Tucker, from the Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia especially for an [interactive website](http://prosody.lib.virginia.edu/) for learning how to scan English poetry.
