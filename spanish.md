# Spanish corpus
We used a corpus of Spanish Golden Age sonnets for training and testing our models. Our corpus is derived from a previously annotated corpus, which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bncolorado/CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro) and was developed by Borja Navarro-Colorado.

Because of the problem of synaloepha, we have slightly modified such corpus, so that each syllable has a stress value. We did it by adding unstressed syllables and keeping stressed syllables using a simple heuristic.

In the following [link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/xpz11n37fyg8gi1/corpus64Features.crf) you can find the corpus that we used for training and testing our models. This corpus includes several features about each syllable.
